# Substitution Cipher

In a substitution cipher, we "encrypt" a message by concealing it in a reversible manner, achieved by substituting each letter with another letter. This process involves using a key, essentially a mapping of each alphabet letter to its corresponding encrypted letter. To decrypt the message, the recipient must possess the key, enabling them to reverse the process and translate the encrypted text (ciphertext) back into the original message (plaintext).
